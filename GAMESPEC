=======GAMEPLAY========
Each player starts with 32 ICBMs.
The player with population still remaining after the other has been wiped out is the winner.
If both players are wiped out, it is a tie.
Each turn, the player can either:
     - Launch ICBMs
     - Negociate peace terms
     - Surrender

The behavior of each of these options is described below.

ICBM launch:
     - The USA can launch ICBMs at a maximum of 4 cities at a time.
     - The USSR can launch 6 at a time.
     - When an ICBM is launched, there are 5 possible results:
       - Miss:     0 casualties
       - Marginal: 10000 casualties
       - Minor:    100000 casualties
       - Major:    500000 casualties
       - Critical: All inhabitants of the target city are killed
     - The probabilities of each of these options is outlined below:
       - Miss     - 10%
       - Marginal - 20%
       - Minor    - 30%
       - Major    - 30%
       - Critical - 10%

      - No progress     - 60%
    - When progress is made, both sides will lose 4 ICBMs
    - Progress must be made at least 5 times if peace is to be achieved
